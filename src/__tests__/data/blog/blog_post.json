While the evidence on food and sleep is in its early stages, research shows a promising connection.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">In a small study conducted by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and published in the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.5384#d3e360\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine</span></a><em>,&nbsp;</em>researchers found eating less fiber and more saturated fat and sugar was associated with lighter, less restorative and more disrupted sleep.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">After four days of eating a heathy controlled diet prepared by nutritionists in a sleep lab, participants in the study on the fifth day ate ad libitum &mdash; a self-selected diet of whatever they wanted &mdash; including an increase in sugar and fat and decrease in fiber.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">The researchers found that diet quality poorly influenced the participant's sleep on the final day of the study and said that diet could be used in the future to improve sleep in those with poor sleep quality.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Another study published in the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.119.014587\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Journal of the American Heart Association</span></a>&nbsp;found that poor sleep quality was linked with both greater food intake and a lower quality diet, which also increases the risk for cardiovascular disease.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">In essence, overeating an unhealthy diet might wreck your sleep.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"p2\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<h2 class=\\\"wys-headline -sm\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Good Food Equals Quality Sleep</h2>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Healthy food choices have also been linked with circadian rhythm, the 24-hour master clock that helps regulate your sleep.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><span class=\\\"s2\\\">(Here are&nbsp;<a href=\\\"../../../post/6-surprising-foods-that-make-you-sleepy\\\">6 Surprising Foods That Make You Sleepy</a>)</span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">For instance, your body produces amino acids and sends the right neurotransmitter messages to the brain when it comes to time for sleep. That means things like shifting eating patterns, changing the times we eat or <a href=\\\"../../../post/5-foods-avoid-before-sleeping\\\">switching diets</a>&nbsp;can throw off your sleep quality, too.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&ldquo;Due to their nutritional properties, some foods favor sleep and rest better than any 'sleeping pill,'\\\" says&nbsp;Pietro L. Ratti, MD, PhD, a neurologist, sleep specialist and medical advisor at&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://whatasleep.com.au/about-us/\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">WhatAsleep</span></a>, an Australian sleep product review site. &ldquo;Eating healthy and providing the body with proper nutrients gives the brain the chemical environment needed to produce the neurotransmitters. They help in maintaining adequate sleep.\\\"</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Here are more tips for using a healthy diet to improve your sleep:</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><strong>1) Don't Skip Meals</strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">The nutrients we get from food are the building blocks for other proteins and minerals required to create the amino acids involved in sleep.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Since our food choices help regulate our circadian rhythm &mdash; including waking up in the morning, falling asleep at night, metabolizing the food we eat, and feeling hungry when we need energy &mdash; meal timing or not skipping meals is important to sleep, according to Ratti.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">If you're truly not hungry, putting off meal time until later is better than skipping it entirely. Also, try eating a small snack or portion just to keep up your energy and get your metabolism humming along.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><strong>2) Eat a Nutritious Breakfast</strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Getting quality sleep through food starts with breakfast.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&ldquo;A lot of people know that what you eat after dinner can impact your sleep, but it's also true that what you eat for breakfast can make a difference,\\\" says Caitlin Self, MS, CNS, LDN, a nutritionist at&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://www.frugalnutrition.com/\\\"><span class=\\\"s1\\\">Frugal Nutrition</span></a>, a Baltimore-based food blog. &ldquo;A hearty, filling breakfast sets you up for stable blood sugar throughout the day, which is one of the most significant factors for mood, energy and sleep.\\\"</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Aim for a breakfast with fat, fiber and protein &mdash; and make carbs (pastry, muffin, potatoes) a supporting cast member rather than the star of the show.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Some good examples: breakfast burrito filled with eggs, beans and cheese; yogurt with fruit and nuts or turkey sausage patty and sliced avocado on whole wheat toast. Short on time? Try this <a href=\\\"../../../post/trade-up-your-breakfast-with-pudding\\\">make ahead breakfast pudding</a>.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><strong>3) Watch Your Sugar Intake</strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Too much sugar affects blood sugar levels, which directly influence energy levels throughout the day. Sugar boosts energy quickly but causes an energy crash soon after.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&ldquo;These sudden changes might lead to poorly-timed naps or a need for extra caffeine,\\\" says Ratti.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Limiting sugar intake helps to keep energy consistent throughout the day and promotes better sleep at night.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><strong>4) Eat Foods That Contribute to Good Sleep</strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">We all know that turkey makes us sleepy from Thanksgiving dinner, but other foods can contribute to good sleep, too.</p>\\n<ul class=\\\"ul1\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\n<li class=\\\"li1\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\"><strong>Bananas&nbsp;</strong>contain serotonin, a hormone that helps set you up for sleep, while&nbsp;<strong>berries&nbsp;</strong>are ripe with melatonin, known as the sleep hormone, as are&nbsp;<strong>almonds</strong>.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"li1\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\"><strong>Fatty fish</strong>&nbsp;like salmon may help you sleep due to its omega 3s and vitamin D content.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"li1\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\">For tryptophan, the amino acid needed to produce sleep hormones, enjoy some good old&nbsp;<strong>turkey&nbsp;</strong>as well as&nbsp;<strong>milk, yogurt, eggs, nuts</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>seeds</strong>.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li class=\\\"li1\\\">\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\"><span class=\\\"s3\\\"><a href=\\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5617749/\\\"><span class=\\\"s4\\\">Research</span></a></span>&nbsp;also gives a nod to&nbsp;<strong>tart cherry juice</strong>&nbsp;for its inflammatory cytokines and melatonin &mdash; ingredients that help with both sleep time and sleep efficiency.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><strong>5) Avoid Heavy, Greasy Or Spicy Meals 3 Hours Before Bedtime</strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Your digestive system works in overdrive if you overeat or chow down a heavy meal too close to bedtime. All that gas, bloating and indigestion can keep you from getting your best night's sleep.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">What's more, spicy foods may increase your metabolism and your body temperature, making it harder to sleep. Some people report that spicy foods seem to cause vivid or weird dreams or nightmares that disrupt their sleep.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Scientists continue to research various aspects of diet and nutrition and their connection to sleep. Trying to make the healthiest diet choices and avoiding some of the dietary pitfalls that can impede sleep may help you improve your sleep quality and allow you to get the quality shuteye you need.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><span class=\\\"s2\\\">Read more about&nbsp;<a href=\\\"../../../blog\\\">food choices and sleep on the Sleep Number blog</a>.</span></p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p class=\\\"wys-body -md\\\" style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><em>Like diet and exercise, quality sleep has a profound impact on our physical, emotional and mental wellbeing.
